 - This Repo Represents **"Food Vision system"**
 - with the help of this project we can easily identity Indian Foods
 
# Description :clipboard:

 - I use Transfer learning (InceptionV3 Model) to create this model and got a 92% accuracy and I Perfrom some EDA 
   to check each classes and Check number of training examples of each food.

 - This project will help people from other countries to classify Indian food easily.
 - I also Perform Data Augmentation for increasing the number of training examples , Data Augmentation can also reduce Overfitting.
 - I use callbacks can helps you prevent overfitting, visualize training progress, debug your code, save checkpoints, generate logs etc.
 - I use InceptionV3 Pre-Trained and got Training Accuracy 93% , you can also use other Pre-Trained Model like ResNet50 , Vgg19 etc
 - I use Flask to create a Web app and make an easy or Simple UI

# Motivation ðŸ’ª 
 Building a Food Vision System represents a pivotal step in the technological evolution of the food industry, with far-reaching implications for both individuals and businesses. One of the primary objectives of a Food Vision System is to empower individuals with greater convenience and knowledge about the food they will be consuming. Whether it's identifying nutritional content for dietary preferences, recognizing allergens for safety concerns, or exploring new recipes for culinary adventures, the convenience is unparalleled. This technology will simplify and enrich food choices by making information readily available at the touch of a button.
